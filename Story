Once upon a time in a forest there lived a crocodile in a river. There was a berry tree in the banks of the river where a monkey came to eat the 
beries everyday.
One day the monkey saw the crocodile and gave him berries. The crocodile was happy and saved it for his wife.
This became a habbit. And they became good friends.

the wife told the crocodile.
